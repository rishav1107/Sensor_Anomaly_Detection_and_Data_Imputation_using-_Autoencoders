# Sensor_Anomaly_Detection_and_Data_Imputation_using-_Autoencoders
This projects is made for IIT Mandi during Summer Internship there , It uses Autoenncoders to fill in the missing values and then Detect Faulty sensors , It uses the techniques of Winsorization to handle the outliers.
This project has a trial project into it to evaluate the efficiency of Autoencoders on an ECG dataset obtained from Kaggle.

**Main Models**

Final Model with More Data: The "final_model_with _more_data" file contains the ultimate model that incorporates data from both the polyhouses. It includes preprocessing steps such as winsorization, filling missing values, and fault detection. This model is considered the most comprehensive and accurate.

Final Model with Polyhouse 1 Data: The "final_model" file represents a model trained solely on data from polyhouse 1. Although it is a subset of thevabove model it provides insights specific to polyhouse 1.

**Additional Models**

Missing Value Imputation: The "missing_values" file showcases three different techniques used for filling missing values in the dataset namely through Autoencoders, Linear Interpolation, KNN

Fault Detection Model: The "fault_detection" file contains a separate model dedicated to detecting faults within the polyhouse dataset.
